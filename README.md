This repository contains the materials for D-Lab [WorkshopName] workshop. Prior experience with [PriorWorkshopWithLink] is assumed.

## Workshop Goals

In this workshop, we provide [WorkshopGoal]. First, we’ll cover [Aim1]. Then, we’ll explore [Aim2]. 

Provide additional detail as required. This section should not be more than 2 paragraphs.

Only if necessary: Basic familiarity with [PriorExperience] is assumed. If you are not familiar with material in [PriorWorkshopWithLink], we recommend attending that workshop first.

## Installation Instructions

We will use [RStudio/Python] to go through the workshop materials, which requires installation of [Software]. Complete the following steps:

1. This step(s) details software to download, with a link.
2. Download these workshop materials:
    * Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository information.
    * Click "Download Zip".
    * Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (we recommend Desktop).
3. Optional: if you’re familiar with git, you can instead clone this repository by opening a terminal and entering [GitCloneCommand].

## Run the Code

Now that you have all the required software and materials, you need to run the code:

Provide instructions on running the code, including how to load relevant software (RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks, etc.) and which file to open up. See other repositories for examples.

Additionally, provide instructions on how to run code once it’s open (running Jupyter cells, RMarkdown cells, etc.).

## Is [Language] not Working on Your Computer?

If you do not have [Language] installed and the materials loaded on your workshop by the time it starts, we *strongly* recommend using the UC Berkeley Datahub to run the materials for these lessons. You can access the DataHub by clicking the following button:

[![Datahub](https://img.shields.io/badge/launch-datahub-blue)](DATAHUB_LINK_HERE)

The DataHub downloads this repository, along with any necessary packages, and allows you to run the materials in an RStudio instance on UC Berkeley's servers. No installation is necessary from your end - you only need an internet browser and a CalNet ID to log in. By using the DataHub, you can save your work and come back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go straight to [DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and you click on the `[Workshop-Name]` folder.

If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can still run these lessons in the cloud, by clicking this button:

By using this button, however, you cannot save your work.
